CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP mb_design_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Performance.Core/Data_Flow_I/MUL_Unit_I/Use_HW_MUL.Using_DSP48_Architectures.No_MUL64.dsp_module_I3/Using_DSP48E1.DSP48E1_I1/Using_FPGA.DSP48E1_I1 output mb_design_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Performance.Core/Data_Flow_I/MUL_Unit_I/Use_HW_MUL.Using_DSP48_Architectures.No_MUL64.dsp_module_I3/Using_DSP48E1.DSP48E1_I1/Using_FPGA.DSP48E1_I1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP mb_design_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Performance.Core/Data_Flow_I/MUL_Unit_I/Use_HW_MUL.Using_DSP48_Architectures.dsp_module_I1/Using_DSP48E1.DSP48E1_I1/Using_FPGA.DSP48E1_I1 multiplier stage mb_design_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Performance.Core/Data_Flow_I/MUL_Unit_I/Use_HW_MUL.Using_DSP48_Architectures.dsp_module_I1/Using_DSP48E1.DSP48E1_I1/Using_FPGA.DSP48E1_I1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

REQP-181#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (mb_design_i/axi_dma_0/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_MM2S_FULL.I_MM2S_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_INCLUDE_MM2S_SF.I_RD_SF/I_DATA_FIFO/BLK_MEM.I_SYNC_FIFOGEN_FIFO/xpm_fifo_instance.xpm_fifo_sync_inst/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
