	--Write Address Channel
	----------------------

	-- The purpose of the write address channel is to request the address and 
	-- command information for the entire transaction.  It is a single beat
	-- of information.

	-- Note for this example the axi_awvalid/axi_wvalid are asserted at the same
	-- time, and then each is deasserted independent from each other.
	-- This is a lower-performance, but simplier control scheme.

	-- AXI VALID signals must be held active until accepted by the partner.

	-- A data transfer is accepted by the slave when a master has
	-- VALID data and the slave acknoledges it is also READY. While the master
	-- is allowed to generated multiple, back-to-back requests by not 
	-- deasserting VALID, this design will add rest cycle for
	-- simplicity.

	-- Since only one outstanding transaction is issued by the user design,
	-- there will not be a collision between a new request and an accepted
	-- request on the same clock cycle.
